            Part I Part II Part III Composing with side-effects Now. If you have thought that the FP guys are crazy, hopefully you&rsquo;re going to end up with a ton of evidence on your hands to finally lock us away into the depths of the abyss, where we truly belong. Or you might have discovered something new, interesting and useful, which, you know, is also good.
There are three things that make functional programming as functional as it gets (or not):

            Part I Part II Part III Higher order functions Functional programmers are all about making things better.
The problem is that we don&rsquo;t know how to make things better.
So we tend to explore different ideas. And most of them don&rsquo;t work. But some turn out to be surprisingly effective. So much so, the other languages tend to get those ideas into their own languages and then when you try to argue why you should learn a proper functional programming language, people look at you like crazy, saying that they already have all the fancy functional programming stuff in their language and that they already know what it is, while their code is still 90% imperative and state mutating shit.

            Part I Part II Part III Hello there, poor soul! How come you found your way to this post? Are you perhaps unhappy with the way programming is done nowadays? Did you perhaps hear someone say that functional programming has all the benefits like:
Simplifying your projects Removing a class of errors and bugs Bringing back joy of programming of early days Well, whether those claims are true or not, you will have to see them for yourself.

            Intro You know, since I accidentially discovered Functional Programming due to being a Security Analyst at a time (and realizing how shitty our software practices are to allow many severe vulnerabilities into production due to C&rsquo;s nonexistent memory safety), I was a hard proponent, or a more fancy word they call us, an evangelist of FP (but that is a topic of its own).
Of course, when I try to do that, I get a massive pushback from people:

            Introduction So, you might have heard that there&rsquo;s a language called OCaml, and that it is one of the affordable ways of getting into Functional Programming (the other one being F#, but that is a topic for another day).
Pros of OCaml OCaml is a really good language. There&rsquo;s a saying that being copied is one of the best compliments that artist can get. Apparently for the programming language it is the same.
